This document provides answers to the frequently asked questions about the migration to OpenSearch.

## What is OpenSearch, and how is it different from Elasticsearch?

[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) is an open-source search and analytics suite derived from Elasticsearch 7.10.2.  It had been the same before it was forked. After the fork, the projects started to diverge slightly. OpenSearch consists of the OpenSearch search engine and OpenSearch Dashboards, which are based on Kibana. OpenSearch maintains compatibility with Elasticsearch 7.10.2 while introducing additional enhancements and features. It is fully open source and developed in a community-driven manner.

## What is Amazon OpenSearch Service?

Amazon OpenSearch Service is a managed search solution that is based on OpenSearch. As part of the service, AWS provides the OpenSearch suite and continues to support legacy Elasticsearch versions until 7.10.

## How is OpenSearch different from the Amazon OpenSearch Service?

OpenSearch refers to the community-driven open-source search and analytics technology. On the other hand, Amazon OpenSearch Service is a managed service provided by AWS that lets users deploy, secure, and run OpenSearch and Elasticsearch at scale without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. It offers the benefits of a fully managed service, including simplified deployment and management, while leveraging the power and capabilities of OpenSearch and Elasticsearch.

## How does Spryker Cloud Commerce OS leverage Amazon OpenSearch service?

As a recognized AWS Partner, Spryker Cloud Commerce OS(SCCOS) relies on AWS-managed services. SCCOS leverages Amazon OpenSearch Service to securely unlock real-time search, monitoring, and analysis of business and operational data for use cases like application monitoring, log analytics, observability, and website search.

## Does it mean that all SCCOS projects are already using Amazon OpenSearch Service?

Yes, all SCCOS projects are already running on Amazon OpenSearch Service, regardless of the engine version of Elasticsearch or OpenSearch you are currently using.

## Can my project migrate to OpenSearch if I it's running Spryker Commerce OS on premises?

Yes, you can enable OpenSearch until version 1.2 on premises, because OpenSearch is an open-source project that can be deployed and run on your own infrastructure.

## If my SCCOS project is running Elasticsearch, do I need to prepare for the migration from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch?

If you are running Elasticsearch version 6.8 or above, no action is required on your part. We will handle the migration from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch. For the projects running lower versions of Elasticsearch, before migrating, we recommend updating Elasticsearch to version 6.8. If you need technical guidance for updating Elasticsearch, [contact our Support team](https://spryker.my.site.com/support/s/).

## How long does it take to migrate from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch?

The migration takes a short time, usually within the maintenance window. We can migrate your project during the maintenance window or on demand.

## Will there any data loss during the migration to OpenSearch?

No, the migration to OpenSearch follows AWS's blue-green deployment strategy, which ensures data continuity and prevents any loss. Your data will remain intact and available in the upgraded environment.

## Will any functionality be lost during the transition to OpenSearch?

No, there won't be any loss of functionality during the migration to OpenSearch. OpenSearch 1 is backward compatible with Elasticsearch 7, ensuring that all features and functions remain accessible after the migration.

## Will there be any downtime during the migration or scaling process?

No, there will not be any downtime during the migration or scaling process. AWS's blue-green deployment strategy ensures uninterrupted service during the migration.

## I am currently using Elasticsearch 7 or older versions. What are the benefits of upgrading to OpenSearch?

Migrating from Elasticsearch 7 or older versions to OpenSearch provides several benefits:

* Enhanced Security: OpenSearch includes built-in security features to protect your data better.

* Continued Support: OpenSearch receives long-term support and updates, ensuring ongoing improvements and maintenance.

* Advanced Features: OpenSearch introduces new features such as better observability, anomaly detection, and data lifecycle management.

* Active Community: OpenSearch benefits from a thriving open-source community, driving continuous enhancement and innovation.

## Why didnâ€™t we get earlier access to OpenSearch?

At Spryker, we prioritize our services' stability, security, and compatibility above all else. Our commitment to these principles means we approach upgrades with the utmost caution, ensuring that we have extensively tested and verified their functionality and compatibility before they are introduced into our ecosystem. Elasticsearch has been a reliable and robust search engine, and many of our customers still use versions under 7.10. Despite Elastic's decision to deprecate some older versions of Elasticsearch, we've been able to maintain their service continuity through our partnership with AWS, which has committed to supporting these versions without deprecation notice. As a result, there was no immediate need to rush an upgrade to OpenSearch.

However, we recognize the potential benefits and features that OpenSearch brings. After thorough testing and validation, we are confident that OpenSearch is a solid platform for the search needs of the Spryker community. As with any upgrade, our commitment remains to ensure the transition is smooth, backward compatible, and minimally disruptive.

## Does the migration to OpenSearch entail any additional costs?

No, the migration does not entail any additional costs. We take care of the migration on our side as part of your existing agreement. The cost of running OpenSearch is similar to Elasticsearch, and any changes in usage or scale can affect overall costs.

## Can I continue using Elasticsearch APIs with OpenSearch?

Yes, you can. OpenSearch maintains backward compatibility with Elasticsearch 7.10, which means all your existing APIs, clients, and applications should continue to work as expected with OpenSearch.

## How is backward compatibility maintained in OpenSearch?

OpenSearch maintains backward compatibility by ensuring its APIs and core search functionality are compatible with Elasticsearch 7.10.2. When OpenSearch was forked from Elasticsearch 7.10.2, the goal was to keep the base functionality and APIs the same. This lets applications and tools built to work with Elasticsearch 7.10.2 to continue functioning with OpenSearch.

In addition, OpenSearch includes a compatibility mode, which lets OpenSearch respond with a version number of 7.10.2. This can be useful for tools or clients that check the version of the search engine and expect to communicate with Elasticsearch 7.10.2.

However, while backward compatibility is a priority, certain features or functionalities from older versions of Elasticsearch are not supported in OpenSearch. We recommend  thoroughly testing your application in a non-production environment when upgrading to a new version or migrating to different software.

Also, as OpenSearch continues to evolve and new versions are released, for the updates on backward compatibility, make sure to to stay up to date with the official OpenSearch documentation or their GitHub page.

## Does OpenSearch support all the plugins that I used with Elasticsearch?

OpenSearch supports most plugins compatible with Elasticsearch 7.10.2. However, it's always a good idea to check the compatibility of specific plugins in the OpenSearch documentation or with a particular plugin's provider. Some cases require plugins to be updated or replaced an OpenSearch-compatible version. Check with your Spryker support team about what specific plugins you are currently using to ensure backward compatibility. You will get a rolling upgrade from the development and staging environment to test the changes before upgrading to OpenSearch in production.

## How will the migration affect my current configurations and settings?

The migration from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch should not affect your current configurations and settings. OpenSearch is designed to be backward compatible with Elasticsearch 7.10.2, which means it should respect your existing configurations and settings. However, when updating to a major version, we recommend to always review update documentation or notes provided by OpenSearch.

## Can I roll back to Elasticsearch if I face issues after migrating to OpenSearch?

While rolling back is generally not recommended, if you experience any significant issues after the migration, a rollback to Elasticsearch 7 is still possible. However, the rollback may require downtime and data migration. The Spryker Cloud Operations team is equipped to facilitate this process. However, long-term support, including security patches and updates, will be provided for OpenSearch, so a rollback should be a temporary solution. After the compatibility issues are fixed, to ensure the project's security and long-term support, it should be migrated to OpenSearch.

## Is there any change in the way I interact with the platform after the upgrade?

No, there is no change in the way you interact with the platform after the upgrade. OpenSearch maintains compatibility with the Elasticsearch APIs, so the operations, requests, and procedures you were accustomed to using with Elasticsearch will continue functioning as before.

## How will the migration impact my data ingestion and query processes?

The migration should not impact your data ingestion and query processes. OpenSearch is designed to be fully backward compatible with Elasticsearch. The APIs used for data ingestion, such as the Index and Bulk APIs, and the query DSL for searching your data, will work as they did in Elasticsearch.

## Are there any security implications with the migration to OpenSearch?

No, there are no security implications with the migration. OpenSearch includes improved security features, such as granular access control, audit logging, and integration with identity providers, which further enhance the security of your deployments. However, we recommend reviewing the security settings and ensuring they align with your organization's security policies.

## Does OpenSearch support the languages and frameworks that Elasticsearch does?

Yes, OpenSearch supports the languages and frameworks as Elasticsearch. This includes all the official clients Elasticsearch supports, such as those for Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Go, .NET, and PHP. You should be able to continue using the same languages and frameworks with OpenSearch.

## Will SCCOS support Elasticsearch 8+ anytime?

 As SCCOS is built on AWS and heavily relies on Amazon OpenSearch Service, we align our strategies to their developments and service offerings. Currently, Amazon OpenSearch Service does not support Elasticsearch 8+. As a result, SCCOS does not support Elasticsearch 8+ by default. This decision is based on our commitment to ensuring the best possible stability, security, and compatibility for our users within the supported AWS ecosystem. We continue to closely monitor developments in this area and adjust our strategies as needed to best serve the needs of our community.

## My on-premises project is running Elasticsearch 8+, what steps should I take to ensure compatibility when migrating to SCCOS?

To ensure compatibility with SCCOS, you need to migrate the project from Elasticsearch 8+ to OpenSearch 1.

However, we understand that sophisticated business models have unique needs, and we are always open to exploring new patterns that enable our customers to leverage and extend SCCOS with their own solutions in a multi-cloud setup.

Therefore, if you have ideas or requirements related to Elasticsearch 8+ or any other technology, we encourage you to contact us. Our primary goal is to ensure that SCCOS is a robust and reliable platform and a customizable solution that can adapt to the changing needs of our customers.


## When can we expect the upgrade to OpenSearch 2 within the Spryker ecosystem?

OpenSearch 2 is already available and we know that it brings several updates compared to its predecessor, OpenSearch 1. We are analyzing these changes to understand their implications. We aim to develop a comprehensive upgrade strategy that ensures our customers experience no disruption in their services during the upgrade. Once we have a robust and tested upgrade plan, we will provide detailed guidance on how to do it.
