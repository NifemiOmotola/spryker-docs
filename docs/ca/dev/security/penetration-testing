In this document we want to inform you about important aspects to consider while preparing and conducting a penetration test.

# General Considerations
Penetration tests are an integral part of improving the security posture of your application. We strongly encourage our customers and partners to conduct penetration tests, especially during go-live preparations and after major updates or project milestones.

## Prerequisites
Please inform our team about your intention to perform a penetration test. You can do this via email by reaching out to secops@spryker.com. Additionally, ensure that you provide at least 7 working daysâ€™ notice. Also, take into account the [AWS Penetration Testing Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/), which outlines prohibited activities.
