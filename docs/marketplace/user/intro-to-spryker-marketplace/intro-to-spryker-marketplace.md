## How do I start with Spryker Marketplace?

For new projects, we provide [B2C](/docs/marketplace/user/intro-to-spryker-marketplace/marketplace-b2c-demo-shop.html) and [B2B Demo Marketplace](docs/marketplace/user/intro-to-spryker-marketplace/marketplace-b2b-demo-shop.html) templates, which are a great starting point.

Even if you don't need marketplace features at first, but you are going to use them in future, the  Demo Marketplaces are still the best starting point. You can just ignore the marketplace features until you actually want to use them.

To learn how to install B2C or B2B Demo Marketplace, see [Spryker Marketplace Setup](/docs/marketplace/dev/setup/spryker-marketplace-setup.html).

## Can I upgrade to marketplace from a regular B2B/B2C shop?

To upgrade to marketplace from a regular Demo Shop, follow [How-To: Upgrade Spryker instance to the Marketplace](/docs/marketplace/dev/howtos/how-to-upgrade-spryker-instance-to-marketplace.html).
