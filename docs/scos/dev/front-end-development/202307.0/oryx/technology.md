Oryx is a frontend framework designed to help developers build web applications using modern technologies and leveraging [Spryker API](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/decoupled-glue-api.html).

Oryx leverages standard technology, frameworks and tools provided by the web platform and the community wherever possible.â€¨ It emphasizes utilizing the capabilities of the web and minimizing the reliance on build tools. During development, Oryx primarily employs JavaScript (JS) but aims to reduce the need for executing JS in the browser. It prioritizes HTML and CSS for delivering a fast-loading experience across various screen sizes.

Furthermore, Oryx is framework-agnostic and can seamlessly integrate into various web frameworks like React and Vue.js. This versatility is achieved using a combination of web components for the user interface and vanilla JS for handling business logic. This approach offers the flexibility of using the entire library with its components or to selectively employing specific layers, like the integration logic.

In terms of styling and layout rendering, Oryx adopts a CSS-first approach, considering CSS as the primary method. It recognizes the capabilities of CSS in handling styling and layout tasks without requiring additional JS logic. Oryx tries to avoid loading JS on the client side, loading snippets of JS rather than a full JS framework. This approach minimizes the overall JS payload.

The following technologies are employed in the development of Oryx:
- [HTML](#html)
- [CSS](#css)
- [TS](#TS)
- [Web Components](#web-components)
- [Lit](#lit)
- [RxJS](#rxjs)
- [Vite](#vite)
- [Storybook](#storybook)
- [Web hosting](#web-hosting)


## HTML

HTML is a markup language used to create web pages and applications. In Oryx, HTML is used to structure the content and layout of the application. It provides a semantic structure to the page, making it easier to understand and maintain. Also, Oryx prioritizes accessibility principles ensuring access to information and functionality for all users.

## CSS

CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the visual presentation of a document written in HTML.

Oryx uses standard CSS syntax and does not use CSS preprocessors because Oryx does not use a global CSS utility library; instead, we have isolated styles per component and because of that we do not want to load global css utils in each component.

Unlike some other CSS methodologies, like Block, Element, or Modifier, Oryx does not rely on a specific naming convention to structure its CSS classes.

## TypeScript

TypeScript (TS) is a superset of JS that adds optional static typing, classes, and interfaces to the language. In Oryx, TS provides type safety and better code organization. It enables developers to catch errors early in the development process and provides better code navigation and refactoring capabilities.

## Web Components

In Oryx, Web Components are used to create reusable UI components that can be used across the application. It enables developers to create complex components with minimal code duplication and provides better code organization and maintainability. It also means that Oryx components are compatible with any other frontend framework and can be integrated into almost any web application.

## Lit

Lit is a lightweight library for creating web components using TS and HTML templates. In Oryx, Lit is used to create reusable and encapsulated UI components that can be easily styled and extended. It provides a simple and intuitive API for creating custom elements and lets developers write less boilerplate code.

You can use Lit to customize Oryx, but you can also use another framework to build web components. Advantages of using Lit:
- Reusable component mixins and controllers.
- Out of the box integration with optimized [reactivity](/docs/scos/dev/front-end-development/202311.0/oryx/architecture/reactivity/reactivity.html) and partial hydration concepts.
- Out of the box integration with [SSR](/docs/scos/dev/front-end-development/202311.0/oryx/architecture/oryx-server-side-rendering.html).

## RxJS

RxJS is a reactive programming library for JS. In Oryx, RxJS is used to handle asynchronous operations. It provides a declarative way to handle events and data streams, making it easier to manage complex data flows and state transitions.

RxJS is predominantly used in the service layer to provide a reactive system that emits new values as you navigate through the (SPA) experience.
RxJS is not a main citizen in the component logic, as we try to hide the reactivity altogether to avoid complexity.

## Vite

Vite is a build tool and development server for modern web projects. In Oryx, Vite is used for fast and efficient development and build times. It provides an optimized build process and a hot-reloading development server, making it easy to develop and test the application in real time. Oryx is not tightly coupled to Vite, and you can use an alternative build tool and development server if you like.

## Storybook

Storybook is an open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation. In Oryx, Storybook is used as a component library to showcase the different UI components in the application. It provides a simple and intuitive way to develop and test UI components in isolation, making it easier to iterate on them and ensure consistency across the application.

## Web hosting

Oryx applications are decoupled applications and can be hosted separately. We recommend hosting Oryx applications at a frontend hosting provider, to benefit from standard features like the following:

- Build process integration: Choose hosting providers with seamless build process integration to streamline updates and deployments.
- HTTP header configuration: Opt for hosting providers that allow flexible configuration of HTTP headers for improved security, caching, and optimizations.
- CDN integration: Look for hosting providers with native CDN integration to boost performance and availability by distributing static assets across a network.
- Rewrites and redirects: Prioritize hosting providers that enable easy configuration of URL rewrites and redirects for managing URL structure and routing.
- Lambda function integration: Select hosting providers that seamlessly integrate with serverless technologies like AWS Lambda to execute custom logic, server-side operations or perform a server-side rendering.

If your Oryx applications requires [Server-Side Rendering](./oryx-server-side-rendering.md) you need to make sure that the right infrastructure is in place at your hosting provider. You can run SSR in a Lambda function or have a long-running server that processes the SSR.

If you have a fairly static application that doesn't require SSR, you could consider a non-frontend hosting provider.

By considering these capabilities, you can optimize the deployment, performance, and customization options for your Oryx application.
