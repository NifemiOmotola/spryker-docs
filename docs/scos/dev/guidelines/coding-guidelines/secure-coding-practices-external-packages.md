## How to add new external package to your project

Sometimes you would like to add a new external package to your project. In this case check our doc to make sure that your project is secure.

### Check security (now and future)

1. Check that the package has no known security vulnerabilities. 
2. Add an automated SAST&SCA tool to your CI/CD to check it regularly for all the packages.

### Check with your Legal (now and future)

Every package comes with a license.
1. Check with your legal team that you can use the package with its license.
2. Add an automated tool to your CI/CD to check it regularly for all the packages.

We can recommend [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) for all the stated above actions. But you are free to use any other tool.
