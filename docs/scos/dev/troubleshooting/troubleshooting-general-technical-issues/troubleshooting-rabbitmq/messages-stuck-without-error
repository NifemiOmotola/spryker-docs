## Title

Messages getting stuck without Error Messages

## Description

Messages are getting stuck/do not get consumed from RabbitMQ queues. They are not getting moved to the error queue and there is no visible error in CloudWatch log groups. Instead, the messages are stuck in the “Ready” queue without being moved to “Unacked” queue.

## Cause
This symptom usually indicates that the queue worker responsible for consuming the messages from the stuck queue is not running. You should switch to your jenkins instance and validate that the queue worker for the queue

The nameing of the queue worker will correspond to the virtual host of the affected queue in RabbitMQ is running and does not encounter errors.

If you see that the queue worker is running, but encounter errors, you should be able to view the error message by clicking on the job and open the console output.

## Solution
If you see that the queue worker encounters errors, you will need to solve these errors. If the queue worker just does not run start up the queue worker by making sure that the project is enabled.

After that, start building the project by clicking on "Build Now" as shown below.
