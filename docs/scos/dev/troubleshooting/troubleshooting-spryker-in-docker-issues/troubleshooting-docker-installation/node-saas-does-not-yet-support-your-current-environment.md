You get the error: `Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: Linux Unsupported architecture (arm64) with Node.js`.

## Solution

Replace x86 based Sass with an ARM based one:

1. In `package.json`, remove `node-sass` dependencies.
2. Add `sass` and `sass-loader` dependencies.

```json
...
"sass": "~1.32.13",
"sass-loader": "~10.2.0",
...
```

3. Update `@spryker/oryx-for-zed`:

```json
...
"@spryker/oryx-for-zed": "~2.11.5",
...
```

4. In `frontend/configs/development.js`, add configuration for `saas-loader`:
```js
loader: 'sass-loader',
options: {
   implementation: require('sass'),
}
```

5. Enter the Docker SDK CLI:

```bash
docker/sdk cli
```

6. Update `package-lock.json` and install dependencies based on your package manager:
    * npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    * yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
7. Rebuild Yves:

```bash
npm run yves
```

8. Rebuild Zed

```bash
npm run zed
```
