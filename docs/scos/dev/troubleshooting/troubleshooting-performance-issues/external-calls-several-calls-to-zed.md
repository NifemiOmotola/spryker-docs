Some actions, parts of the website, or the whole website is slow.

## Cause

A lot of Zed calls.

Example of more than one Zed call in the Blacfire report:

## Solution

Spryker recommends having as few Zed calls as possible. Ideally, it has to be one only. Optimize to have one call where possible.
