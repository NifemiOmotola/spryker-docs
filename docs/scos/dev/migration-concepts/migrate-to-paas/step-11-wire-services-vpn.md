In case if there are some third party services that won't be migrated to Spryker PaaS for whatever reason we still have an opporutnity to wire those to PaaS using VPN, AWS VPC Peering, AWS Private Link etc...

Such connections should be requested via [Spryker Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com/).
