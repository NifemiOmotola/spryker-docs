After you have [migrated non-standard services](/docs/scos/dev/migration-concepts/migrate-to-paas/step-3-migrate-non-standard-services.html) and your application is up and running in the local environment, you can deploy it on remote servers.

Thoroughly review the existing Spryker PaaS environments at [Environments overview](/docs/ca/dev/environments-overview.html) and determine which environments you need for your project.

Following the assessment, initiate the process of requesting the environments themselves. For details on the process of requesting the environments, see [Environment provisioning](docs/ca/dev/environment-provisioning.html).
