## Getting ready
Once your application is up and running on a local machine, operating seamlessly in the local environment, the subsequent action involves provisioning it on remote servers.

# Spryker PaaS environments
You can explore an overview of the Spryker PaaS environments [here](/docs/ca/dev/environments-overview.html#basic-concept.html). Take the time to go through this information and determine which environments are essential for your project.

# Request environment
Following this assessment, the next step is to initiate the process of requesting the environments themselves. A comprehensive explanation of this process is available [here](docs/ca/dev/environment-provisioning.html).
