## Request Spryker PaaS environments

Once your application is up and running on a local machine, operating seamlessly in the local environment, the subsequent action involves provisioning it on remote servers.

You can explore an overview of the Spryker PaaS environments [here](/docs/ca/dev/environments-overview.html#basic-concept.html). Take the time to go through this information and determine which environments are essential for your project.

Following this assessment, the next step is to initiate the process of requesting the environments themselves. A comprehensive explanation of this process is available [here](docs/ca/dev/environment-provisioning.html).
