This document describes the steps that you need to consider to implement the prepayment method without integrating with a third-party payment service provider.

This HowTo section shows how to add a new module called `PaymentMethods`.

If this is your first time creating a new module, see [Tutorial: Adding a New Module](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/extending-spryker/development-strategies/project-modules/adding-a-new-module.html).

{% info_block infoBox "Implementation order" %}

The order of the implementation steps does not matter; however, ensure to complete all the steps.
