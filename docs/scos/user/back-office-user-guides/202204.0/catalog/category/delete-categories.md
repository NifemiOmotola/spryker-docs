To delete a category in the Back Office, follow the steps:

1. Go to **Catalog&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Category**.
2. 
You are taken to the *Delete category [Category name]* page.
On *Delete category [Category name]*, you see detailed information about everything that will be de-assigned, moved, or deleted along with that category.
2. Select the checkbox next to **Yes, I am sure** to confirm your awareness and click **Delete**.

   {% info_block infoBox %}

    Products assigned to a deleted category are de-assigned and remain in the system. If the same products are assigned to other categories, they stay assigned to those.

   {% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block infoBox %}

Child categories of the deleted category are assigned to its parent categories.
