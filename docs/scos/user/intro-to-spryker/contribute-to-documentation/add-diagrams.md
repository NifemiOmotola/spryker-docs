## Add diagrams to documentation

After creating a diagram, to embed it into a document, do the following:

1. In the diagrams.net editor, click **File > Embed > HTML...**.
2. In the **HTML** window, click **Create**.
    This generates a script for displaying the diagram.
3. Copy the script and paste it into the needed place of a document.
4. Submit a PR with the changes. For instructions on submitting PRs, see [Edit documentation via pull requests](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/contribute-to-documentation/edit-documentation-via-pull-requests.html).
    After the PR is merged, the diagram appears on the page.
