## PHP 7

PHP 7.4 is officially EOL for Spryker software since July 2022. Please upgrade to 8.0+ immediately to avoid issues with security or critical updates.

## PHP 8

Since October 2021, Spryker has been compatible with PHP 8.0.
PHP 8.1 support has been finished July 2022.
We recommend using PHP 8.1 now.

Note: PHP 8.0+ is a hard requirement from 19.10.2022 due to the modules being now PHP 8.0+.
