When writing and reviewing documentation at Spryker, we rely on external style guides:

* [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
* [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)

For most contributors that are not part of our technical writing team, the external style guides are sufficient to greatly improve the quality of writing.

The goal of our own style guide is to provide guidance for the cases that are specific to Spryker or those not covered by the external style guides.
