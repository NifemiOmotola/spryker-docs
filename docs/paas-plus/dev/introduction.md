Keeping enterprise software up-to-date is a known hurdle. Especially when it comes to sophisticated transactional business models with complex customizations. Current upgrade strategies often require a high investment of time, resources, and money that projects would rather spend on innovation. However, low upgrade frequency comes with reduced access to security and improvements patches and new features.

Spryker Code Upgrader is a service in Spryker PaaS+ which addresses application upgradability challenges. The Upgrader runs on Spryker CI and provides automated upgrades and code quality checks, and you retain full control of what customizations to make in your application. By reducing upgrade efforts to a minimum, the Upgrader makes it easy to keep up with Sprykerâ€™s daily releases.

## Semi-automated upgrade process


Once a week, the Upgrader checks the connected branch in your application's repository. If new updates were released since your last upgrade, the Upgrader creates a pull request. The pull request contains [minor and patch module versions](/docs/scos/dev/architecture/module-api/semantic-versioning-major-vs.-minor-vs.-patch-release.html) which you need to review and merge. If there are any major updates, the PR will contain instructions for a manual update.
