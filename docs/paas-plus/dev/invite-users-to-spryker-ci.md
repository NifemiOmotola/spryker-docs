To collaborate with a teammate, you need to invite them to your workspace and add them to a project. The only exceptions are admins and the workspace owner who have access to all projects in the workspace.

To invite a teammate, do the following:

1. In Spryker CI, go to **People**.
2. On the **People** page, click **Invite new people**.

3. On the **Invite new people** page, enter one or more **EMAILS** to send invites to.
    If you need to invite more than three users at a time, click **+** to add more email fields.
