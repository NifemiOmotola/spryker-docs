To collaborate with a team mate you need to invite them to the workspace and add them to the selected project. The exceptions are admins and the workspace owner who have access to all projects in the workspace.

To invite the teammate, do the following:

1. In Spryker CI, go to **People**.
2. On the **People** page, click **Invite new people**.

3. On the **Invite new people** page, enter one or more **EMAILS** to send invites to.
    If you need to invite more than three users at a time, click **+** to add more email fields.
