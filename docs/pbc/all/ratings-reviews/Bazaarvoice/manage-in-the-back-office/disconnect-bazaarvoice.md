You can always disconnect the Bazaarvoice app from your store. For example, after the trial period, you might decide not to continue with the app. 
To disconnect Bazaarvoice, on the Bazaarvoice app details page, next to the **Configure** button, hold the pointer over <span class="inline-img"><img src="https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/aop/user/apps/bazzarvoice/disconnect-button.png"></span> and click **Disconnect**. Disconnecting the app removes the Bazaarvoice UGC and automatically restores the default Spryker [Product Ratings and Reviews feature](/docs/scos/user/features/{{site.version}}/product-rating-and-reviews-feature-overview.html) feature.
