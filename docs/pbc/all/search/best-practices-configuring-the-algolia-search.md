Custom ranking

Attributes for customizing ranking
If you want the most popular recipes to appear first in your results, you can add business-metric attributes such as the number of likes, ratings, or sales. In the recipe example, this includes likes, sales, and gluten_free.

Attributes for custom ranking are either numeric or boolean.
