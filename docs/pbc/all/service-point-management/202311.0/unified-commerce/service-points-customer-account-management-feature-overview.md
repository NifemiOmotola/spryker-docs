A Service Points + Customer Account Management Feature allows customers to select a service point during checkout.
Service Point can be selected using Service Point Search Widget, see Service Point Feature Overview.
The default strategy uses a service point address during checkout. This behavior can be customized to ask customers to provide their address instead. (e.g. if a system needs to be customized to enable Ship-from-Store where customers select a local store from where the order will be shipped to them and also provides their home address)
