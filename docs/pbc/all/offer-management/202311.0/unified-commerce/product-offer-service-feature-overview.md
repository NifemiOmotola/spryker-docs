The *Product Offer Service* feature lets you assign service point services to product offers. Multiple services can be assigned to a product offer as long as the services belong to the same service point.

For more information on shipment types, see [Shipment feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/carrier-management/202311.0/base-shop/shipment-feature-overview.html).

To learn how to assign services to product offers, see [Create and edit product offers](/docs/pbc/all/offer-management/{{page.version}}/unified-commerce/unified-commerce-create-and-edit-product-offers.html).
