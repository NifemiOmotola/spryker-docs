Disconnecting Payone from your store removes its payment methods from the store configuration. However, you can disconnect Payone only if there are no open orders that still use the Payone payment methods.

To disconnect the Payone app from your store, on the Payone app details page, next to the **Configure** button, hold the pointer over <span class="inline-img">![disconnect-button](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/aop/user/apps/bazzarvoice/disconnect-button.png)</span> and click **Disconnect**.
