In a Marketplace business model, the partnership is usually based on contracts, or relations, between sellers and buyers.
The B2B Merchant Contracts feature allows for creating and managing such relations and relation requests.

In the context of the Marketplace relations, there are three key actors: marketplace operator, merchant, and buyer.

* The marketplace operator owns the platform and acts as a broker between merchants and buyers.
* The merchants are sellers usually represented by a [company](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/company-account-feature-overview/company-accounts-overview.html#company).
* The buyers are often [business units](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/company-account-feature-overview/business-units-overview.html) of companies that purchase products or services from the merchants.

There are two ways to initiate a relation:

- Merchant or marketplace operator creates a merchant relation in the Back Office.
- Company user creates a relation request on the Storefront. Once the merchant approves the request, the relation is created.

## Creation of a merchant relation in a Back Office by merchant or marketplace operator

A merchant or a marketplace operator can create a merchant relation in the Back Office. For details on how to do that, see [Create merchant relations](/docs/pbc/all/merchant-management/{{page.version}}/marketplace/manage-in-the-back-office/manage-merchant-relations\create-merchant-relations.html).

After the relation has been created in the Back Office, it appears on the Storefront on *My Company -> Merchant relations* page of the company user.

## Initiation of the relation request by a company user

Company user can request a merchant relation from a merchant. Once the merchant approves the request, the merchant relation is created.

### Merchant relation request creation by a company user

Company user can initiate the creation of a merchant relation by creating a merchant relation request on the Storefront. The company user can create the relation request either from the merchant page by clicking **Send request**, from the Product Details page by clicking **Merchant Relation Request** under the name of the merchant selling the product, or from the *Merchant Relation Requests* page by clicking **Create request**.

In the merchant relation request form, the company user has to specify the business units they want to create the merchant relation for, and the business unit owner - which is the business unit that will have the formal contract for this relation. Optionally, the company user also leave a message for the merchant.
After the company user submitted the relation request, it appears on the *Merchant Relation Requests* page with *Pending* status. Once the merchant approves or denies the relation requests, its status changes to *Approved* or *Denied*.

The company user can view details of the created merchant details request and cancel pending merchant relations requests. [QUESTION: CAN THEY CANCEL JUST PENDING REQUESTS, OR APPROVED AS WELL] However, they cannot edit the submitted requests.

### Merchant relation request approval by a merchant or marketplace operator

Once the company user submitted the merchant relation request, the merchant receives a notification via the email.


The establishment of a merhant and buyer relations begins with creation of the relation request by a buyer, or company user. After the company user has submitted the relation request, the merchant or marketplace operator can either approve or reject the relation.
