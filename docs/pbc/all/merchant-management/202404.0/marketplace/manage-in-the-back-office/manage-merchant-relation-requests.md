A marketplace operator can view, approve, and reject merchant relation requests created by buyers. For details on the merchant relation requests, see [Initiation of the merchant relation by a company user](docs\pbc\all\merchant-management\202404.0\marketplace\merchant-b2b-contracts-feature-overview.html#initiation-of-the-merchant-relation-by-a-company-user).

Once a company user creates a merchant relation request, it appears in *Marketplace -> Merchant Relation Requests*.

To approve or reject a merchant relation request, do the following:
