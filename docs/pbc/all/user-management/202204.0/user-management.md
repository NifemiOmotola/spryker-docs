The *User Management* capability lets you create and manage Back Office users and their permissions.

A Back Office user with permissions can create Back Office accounts. For instructions, see [Create users]()

Permissions are managed with the help of *user roles* and *user groups*.

Each Back Office user has a role that defines their permissions to perform actions. For example, a content manager does not process orders, but you may want them to be able to view orders. 

* Sections
* Subsections
* Actions
