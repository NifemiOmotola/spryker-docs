The *User Management* capability lets you create and manage Back Office users and their permissions.

A Back Office user with permissions can create Back Office accounts. For instructions, see [Create users]()

Permissions are managed with the help of *user roles* and *user groups*.

A user role allows or denies access to the following:

* Sections
* Subsections
* Actions
