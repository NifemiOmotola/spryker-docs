This document describes how to create user groups.

## Prerequisites

* If you are new to the **Users** section, you might want to start with [Best practices: Managing users and their permissions with roles and groups](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/users/best-practices-managing-users-and-their-permissions-with-roles-and-groups.html).
* Create at least one user role. For instructions, see [Creating user roles](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/users/managing-user-roles/creating-user-roles.html).
* Review the [reference information](#reference-information-creating-user-groups) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Creating groups

1. Go to **Users&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> User Groups**.
2. Click **Create Group**.
3. On the **Create new Group**, page enter a **TITLE**.
4. Select one or more **ASSIGNED ROLES**.
5. Click **Save**.
    This opens the **Edit Group** page with the success message displayed.
