[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-de) is a financial infrastructure platform that enables businesses to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities.

The Stripe integration in Spryker is part of the App Composition Platform and supports both the default Storefront Yves and Spryker GLUE APIs.

## Supported business models

The Stripe App supports B2B and B2C models.

## Stripe features

- Interface within the Spryker ACP catalog to connect with Stripe: You can connect to Stripe from the App Composition Platform.
- Easy switch between Test and Live modes: You can test payments in either mode.
- Responsive Redirect Payment Page: Once a connection is set up between Spryker and Stripe, upon checkout, end users are redirected to a Spryker-hosted payment page where they can view activated payment methods. This works both on the web and mobile.
- Viewing the activated payment methods in the Stripe dashboard.
- GLUE API support: Support for customers using Spryker headless.
- Authorize payments and capture later: The default OMS configuration lets you authorize cards and capture the order amount either after shipping or based on the established business logic.
- Default OMS Configuration: We provide a default OMS configuration that you can use as an example or modify to align with your business logic.

## Prerequisites for using the Stripe app

1. Stripe account.
2. Connect your Stripe account to the Spryker Platform account. Request this link by [creating a case](https://support.spryker.com/s/).
3. Your project is ACP-enabled. For instructions, see [App Composition Platform installation](/docs/acp/user/app-composition-platform-installation.html). Make sure you are using the latest version of our Message Bus. We'll verify this during onboarding, and a migration may be necessary to enable the Stripe app.
4. You have the required [SCCOS prerequisites](/docs/pbc/all/payment-service-provider/{{page.version}}/base-shop/third-party-integrations/stripe/install-stripe.html).
5. Make sure [your countries are supported by Stripe](https://stripe.com/global).
6. Make sure [your business is not restricted by Stripe](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses).

## Payment methods

The Stripe app supports all payments enabled by Stripe in your region. For more information, see [Payment methods in Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods/overview).
However, our team only tested the following payment methods:
- Cards: including Visa and Mastercard
- Debit card
- Bank transfer
- Klarna
- Apple Pay
- Google Pay
- Direct Debit (SEPA) / Sofort√ºberweisung
- iDEAL
- Link
- Przelewy24
- Giropay

{% info_block infoBox "Bank transfers" %}

Stripe supports bank transfers in specific regions. For details on this payment method, see the Stripe documentation on [Bank transfer payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/bank-transfers) here.

## Current limitations

The Stripe App has limited or no support for the following features:
- Refunds & Payment Cancellation: Handling refunds & payment cancellation via the Spryker OMS.
- Payment Authorization & Capture: The current logic works with separate authorization & capture. Hence, all payment methods go through this transition.
- Payment Authorization Timeout: There is currently a one-day timeout for authorizing payments. This means that payment methods such as bank transfers, which are not authorized within this timeframe, will experience a timeout. We recommend extending the timeout from one day to seven days.
- Multi-Capture: Partial capture of payment for order items.
