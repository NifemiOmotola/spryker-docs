Disconnecting Stripe from your store removes its payment methods from the store configuration. However, you can disconnect Stripe only if there are no open orders that still use the Stripe payment method.

To disconnect the Stripe app from your store, do the following:
1. In your store's Back Office, go to **Apps**.
2. Click **Stripe**.
3. On the Stripe app details page, next to the **Configure** button, hold the pointer over <span class="inline-img">![disconnect-button](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/aop/user/apps/bazzarvoice/disconnect-button.png)</span> and click **Disconnect**.
4. In the message that appears, click **Disconnect**. This removes the Stripe configurations from the Back Office and from the Storefront.
