Onboarding to Spryker CI consists of the following steps.


## Get invited to your workspace

To get started, provide the email of your cloud admin. The admin user will be a super user. They will be able to change repositories and invite new users to their workspace.

Once we receive the admin's email address, we will provision a workspace and send you an email invitation.

## Go to your workspace

You receive an email with a one-time invitation token, but your invitation is always active when you sign in at [Spryker CI](https://buddy.works/). Create your account and accept the invitation to the workspace.
