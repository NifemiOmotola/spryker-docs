After connection of the repository to Spryker CI, you can change a target branch for pull requests (PRs). The target branch is the branch to which the changes from the Spryker Code Upgrader PR will be merged.

To select a target branch, do the following:

1. In Spryker CI, go to **Code**.
2. On the **Code** page, click **Branches**.

![Spryker CI Code - Branches](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/paas%2B/dev/select-target-branch-for-prs.md/branches-tab.png)

3. Near the branch name that you want to use as a target, click the vertical ellipsis button.
4. Click **Set as default branch** to select the branch as a target.
