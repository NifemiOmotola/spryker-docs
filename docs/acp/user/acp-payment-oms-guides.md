**Introduction:**

This guide outlines the steps to set up your project with the ACP payment app, ensuring compatibility with your customized OMS configuration.

## Configuring OMS for Your Project

The default ACP payment OMS configuration is located at `vendor/spryker/sales-payment/config/Zed/Oms/ForeignPaymentStateMachine01.xml`.

However, as each project has its own order flow and unique use-cases, you'll want to customize your OMS configuration and still
be compatible with payment methods from ACP Catalog. Follow these steps:

1. Familiarize yourself with OMS basics by referring to the [Install the Order Management feature](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-features/install-the-order-management-feature.html) guide.
2. Create your own payment OMS configuration based on `ForeignPaymentStateMachine01.xml`. Copy this file along with the `Subprocess/` folder to the project root `config/Zed/oms`.
3. Rename the file and update the `<process name=""` value within the file to be equal to the file name.
4. Enabled your new OMS configuration in the config file.

```php
// config_default.php

$config[OmsConstants::PROCESS_LOCATION] = [
    OmsConfig::DEFAULT_PROCESS_LOCATION, # check that you have this line
];
$config[OmsConstants::ACTIVE_PROCESSES] = [
    //...
    'MyProjectForeignPaymentStateMachine01',
];
$config[SalesConstants::PAYMENT_METHOD_STATEMACHINE_MAPPING] = [
    //...
    PaymentConfig::PAYMENT_FOREIGN_PROVIDER => 'MyProjectForeignPaymentStateMachine01',
];
```

The main OMS file includes `<subprocesses>` â€“ similar to libraries or building blocks with their own `<states>`, `<transitions>`, and `<events>`.

```xml
<subprocesses>
    <process name="PaymentAuthorization" file="Subprocess/PaymentAuthorization01.xml"/>
    <!-- Other subprocesses -->
</subprocesses>
```

Each process in the `<subprocesses>` section has a start state, one or more final states, and they are linked to the main State Machine .xml file.

## Customizing for Your Business Flow

If your project doesn't involve product shipping, customize the main .xml file and each subprocess .xml file.

### Without shipping

For example, you can change the transition from `"invoiced"` to `payment capture ready` state, making a direct transition
from `"invoiced"` to `"payment capture pending"` with `event = start payment capture`, which has the command `"Payment/Capture"` on-enter.

```xml
<transition happy="true">
    <source>invoiced</source>
    <target>payment capture pending</target>
    <event>start payment capture</event>
</transition>
```

### Without Return and Refund

If your project doesn't require returns and refunds, remove the `"ItemReturn"` and `"PaymentRefund"` processes from the main .xml file under `<subprocesses>` and at the bottom of the file.

```xml
<!-- Remove these lines -->
<process name="ItemReturn" file="Subprocess/ItemReturn01.xml"/>
<process name="PaymentRefund" file="Subprocess/PaymentRefund01.xml"/>
```

Also, remove the transition in the main file using states from the removed processes:

```xml
<!-- Remove this transition -->
<transition>
    <source>returned</source>
    <target>payment refund ready</target>
    <event>refund</event>
</transition>
```

Now, your OMS will not include blocks for `"ItemReturn"` and `"PaymentRefund"`.

### Without Payment Authorization and Cancellation

For a simpler payment flow without pre-authorization, cancellation, and refunds, your configuration will be much simpler without these blocks:

- PaymentAuthorization
- PaymentCancel
- ItemReturn
- PaymentRefund

            <transition happy="true">

    <process name="PaymentCapture" file="Subprocess/PaymentCapture01.xml"/>
    <process name="ItemSupply" file="Subprocess/ItemSupply01.xml"/>
    <process name="ItemClose" file="Subprocess/ItemClose01.xml"/>

</statemachine>
```
